    - Mutability - Non Mutability

    Object and Mutability
       
       - Everything is object in python

        Object 
            - identity
            - type
            - value

        - Mutable   -> changeable
        - Immutalbe -> NOT changeable

        We look for mutability through identity and not value.

        sugar_amount = 2
        sugar_amouunt = 12

        We change the `reference` -> we are not changing the actual value (unlike other programming languages)
